neutral-milk-hotel|When you were young You were the king of carrot flowers And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet  And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for  And this is the room One afternoon I knew I could love you And from above you how I sank into your soul Into that secret place where no one dares to go  And your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking And dad would dream of all the different ways to die Each one a little more than he could dare to try
neutral-milk-hotel|What a beautiful face I have found in this place That is circling all 'round the sun What a beautiful dream That could flash on the screen In a blink of an eye and be gone from me Soft and sweet Let me hold it close and keep it here with me  And one day we will die And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea But for now we are young Let us lay in the sun And count every beautiful thing we can see Love to be In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me  What a curious life we have found here tonight There is music that sounds from the street There are lights in the clouds Anna's ghost all around Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me Soft and sweet How the notes all bend and reach above the trees  Now how I remember you How I would push my fingers through Your mouth to make those muscles move That made your voice so smooth and sweet But now we keep where we don't know All secrets sleep in winter clothes With one you loved so long ago Now he don't even know his name  What a beautiful face I have found in this place That is circling all 'round the sun And when we meet on a cloud I'll be laughing out loud I'll be laughing with everyone I see Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
neutral-milk-hotel|Two headed boy All floating in glass The sun it has passed Now it's blacker than black I can hear as you tap on your jar I am listening to hear where you are I am listening to hear where you are  Two headed boy Put on sunday shoes And dance round the room to accordion keys With the needle that sings in your heart Catching signals that sound in the dark Catching signals that sound in the dark We will take off our clothes And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine And when all is breaking Everything that you could keep inside Now your eyes ain't moving Now they just lay there in their climb  Two headed boy With pulleys and weights Creating a radio played just for two In the parlor with a moon across her face And through the music he sweetly displays Silver speakers that sparkle all day Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face And in the dark we will take off our clothes And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine  Two headed boy There is no reason to grieve The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves Left beneath christmas trees in the snow And I will take you and leave you alone Watching spirals of white softly flow Over your eyelids and all you did Will wait until the point when you let go
neutral-milk-hotel|The only girl I've ever loved Was born with roses in her eyes But then they buried her alive One evening in 1945 With just her sister at her side And only weeks before the guns All came and rained on everyone Now she's a little boy in Spain Playing pianos filled with flames On empty rings around the sun I'll sing to say my dream has come  But now we must pack up every piece Of the life we used to love Just to keep ourselves At least enough to carry on  And now we ride the circus wheel With your dark brother wrapped in white Says it was good to be alive But now he rides a comet's flame And won't be coming back again The Earth looks better from a star That's right above from where you are He didn't mean to make you cry With sparks that ring and bullets fly On empty rings around your heart The world just screams and falls apart  But now we must pack up every piece Of the life we used to love Just to keep ourselves At least enough to carry on  And here's where your mother sleeps And here is the room where your brothers were born Indentations in the sheets Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore And it's so sad to see the world agree That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes

neutral-milk-hotel|And the first one tore a picture Of a dead and hanging man  Who was kissing foreign fishes  That flew right out from this hands And when I put my arms around him I felt the blushing blood run through my cheeks And an eeriness surrounded when his tongue began to speak And he said...Oh boy you are so pretty Enough to wrap tight in rice-paper string.  And when I finally kissed him the whole world began to ring Lost like a bell that's tipping over  With two cracks along both sides  And I knew the world was over so I took a look outside And watched the fires that were reaching  Up to the weather vane and the tops of trees  And the waiting scene and the Sunday dream They're all waiting here for me  Deli markets with their flower stands And pretty girls and the burning men  Hanging out on the hooks next to the window displays And I took out my tongue twice removed from my face  Across a bridge and across the mountains Threw a nickel in a fountain  To save my soul from all these troubled times  And all the drugs that I don't have the guts to take  To soothe my mind so I'm always sober Always aching, always heading towards  Mass suicide, occult figurines And wasted gas-station attendants Attending to their jobs And a nice drive in the country  Finds a nice cliff to drop off  Oh when this life just gets so grating  All the grittiness of life But don't take those pills your boyfriend gave you You're too wonderful to die  And the last one tore a picture From the pornographic page When all the pleasure points attacking All the looks of love were staged And it's a lie that you've been given That just hurts you every day So why should i lay here naked When it's just too far away From anything we could call loving Any love worth living for So I'll sleep out in the gutter  You can sleep here on the floor And when I wake up in the morning  I won't forget to lock the door Because with a match that's mean and some gasoline You won't see me anymore

the-clash|I slept and I dreamed of a time long ago I saw an army of rebels, dancing on air I dreamed as I slept, I could see the campfires, A song of the battle, that was born in the flames, And the rebels were waltzing on air.  I danced with a girl to the tune of a waltz That was written to be danced on the battlefield I danced to the tune of a voice of a girl A voice that called "Stand till we fall We stand till all the boys fall."  As we danced came the news that the war was not won 5 armies were coming, with carrige and gun Through the heart of the camp Swept the news from the front A cloud crossed the moon, a child cried for food We knew the war could not be won.  So we danced with a rifle, to the rhythm of the gun In a glade through the trees I saw my only one Then the earth seemed to rise hell hot as the sun The soldiers were dying, there was tune to the sighing. The song was an old rebel one.  As the smoke of our hopes rose high from the field My eyes played tricks through the moon and the trees I slept as I dreamed I saw the army rise A voice began to call, stand till you fall The tune was an old rebel one.

I hear them crying Eastside Jimmy and Southside Sue Both said they needed something new  Standing at the gates of the west In the shadow again I'm standing at the gates of the west In the shadow again

the-clash|The panorama of the city is wrong In fact the city seems to be gone! Burning rubber and smoke in my eyes There's a flat burning junkheap For twenty square miles! They took it into the nuclear mine Judging by this, they left nothing behind Down in the bunkers in the crust of the earth Now crouch the wealthy and the noble of birth  If I could a ride a train around the city That holds this as our fate I'd hide from electro-circuit central To the shock inducer gate Not forgetting the by-pass Across the Washington hooks Through the phones and desks and screens Of the Kremlin's crook of crooks  There's some panel in a circuit board Destination of the override Scanning the wild wind Blowing through the Berlin corridor Spotlit in a palace, shielded from dust Malfunction or not, the fail safe is the crux So far away from us, Shaking with the mystery tears One lonely night in Ladbroke Grove Far away in the deserts of Omaha! They got it nailed down-Swiss tight! The bank notes of Europe The emperors and kings Curl in the autumn as the burning of leaves And I've cleaned my black guitar

the-clash|Between cool confusion And kung fu in the car park Could the weekend be losing That reactive spark  Even in the shebeen Or down in the meat rack Longtime I feel cold To send Cinderella's shoe back  Along the length of the wire Party jam on the line I can't hear a thing Can't get no number nine  Now we must get in touch If the night is to burn Someone out there in luck Lend me your star for a turn  As heroes fix their hair Some are saving their breath Just on the walkways tonight For a glue bag death  Screens flick in unison Some gaze at the soul From the tiers and the heights Go for the fifteenth floor stroll  It's immediately obvious; Anybody star-gilt Would have left this club Way before it was built  This strikes you so late As the guy with the broom Sweeps you and the bottles Right out of the room  Now I wash in the factory Confess in the tile house I don't need to bleed anybody To strike out  Today my godfather He sent a note from the jail Said go get 'em kid But don't get chained to the rail  Between cool confusion And kung fu in the car park Could the weekend be losing That romantic spark  Even in the shebeen Or down in the meat rack Long time I feel cold To send Cinderella's shoe back

And hear the gulls they cry for more. Good day to you sweet Autumn, so gently you appear. Why I never even realized those rustic times were near. The moment's changing from a dusty green to gold, The Summer fair she has grown old. The Summer fair she has grown old. And away in the blue of the skies and over the trees How the carnival flies on the wings of a breeze. You've had your time and now it's mine for me to go, These colder days they move too slow. These older days they move too slow. So the Summertime is leaving, and the carnival's away, So the sunshine is relieving us of all our sunny days. But I'll be waiting for to greet your fleeting calls, So come back soon the carnival. So come back soon the carnival. Come back soon.

midlake|The Summertime's escaping, and the carnival's away, And the sunshine is awaiting for another sunny day. Breakers whisper to the shells upon the shore, And hear the seagulls they cry for more. And hear the gulls they cry for more. Good day to you sweet Autumn, so gently you appear. Why I never even realized those rustic times were near. The moment's changing from a dusty green to gold, The Summer fair she has grown old. The Summer fair she has grown old. And away in the blue of the skies and over the trees How the carnival flies on the wings of a breeze. You've had your time and now it's mine for me to go, These colder days they move too slow. These older days they move too slow. So the Summertime is leaving, and the carnival's away, So the sunshine is relieving us of all our sunny days. But I'll be waiting for to greet your fleeting calls, So come back soon the carnival. So come back soon the carnival. Come back soon.

radiohead|Rows of houses, all bearing down on me I can feel their blue hands touching me All these things into position All these things we'll one day swallow whole And fade out again and fade out  This machine will, will not communicate These thoughts and the strain I am under Be a world child, form a circle Before we all go under And fade out again and fade out again  Cracked eggs, dead birds Scream as they fight for life I can feel death, can see its beady eyes All these things into position All these things we'll one day swallow whole Fade out again Fade out again  Immerse your soul in love Immerse your soul in love

radiohead|The breath of the morning I keep forgetting The smell of the warm summer air  I live in a town Where you can't smell a thing You watch your feet For cracks in the pavement  Up above Aliens hover Making home movies For the folks back home  Of all these weird creatures Who lock up their spirits Drill holes in themselves And live for their secrets  They're all Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight  Oh  I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane Late at night when I'm driving Take me on board their beautiful ship Show me the world as I'd love to see it  I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life They'd shut me away But I'd be alright Alright I'm alright Alright  I'm just Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight Uptight
